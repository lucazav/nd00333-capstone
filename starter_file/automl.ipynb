In particular, the RandomForest algorithm follows the *bagging* method; whereas the GradientBoosting one follows the *boosting* method. Ensemble learning methods combine individual models into a new higher performance model. In case of bagging, the ensemble model tends to have less variance. In case of boosting, the ensemble model tries to fix the error of each base model, so its performance are very high (even if it is prone to overfitting).\n",
